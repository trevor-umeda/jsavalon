Problems
=====
* Spaghetti code. Pretty damn hard to find anything. Just cus using old code from old project. 
	* Improperly and inconsistently named methods/variables
	* Too many files. They can be consolidated. Also not clear and what goes in where. 
	* Too many random dependencies that we still don't need.
* Too much info held in the client side? Keeps server side light but has security issues.
